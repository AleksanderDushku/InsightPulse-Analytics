Based on this metrics as an example, that are stored in the prometheus! I want a python code script code using anthropic, that will have a as a request a human readable text like "what is status of this namespace" and this text is going to be translated by claude into a prometheus query
or promql, which will be executed against prometheus api, and the response from the query  will be validated by claude and return a human readable response based on the first request.

ContentBlock(text='To check the status of the Prometheus instances, you can use the following PromQL query:\n\n```\nup{job="prometheus"}\n```\n\n
This query will return the current status of each Prometheus instance that has the job label set to "prometheus". 
The `up` metric is a special metric in Prometheus that indicates whether the instance is reachable and healthy.\n\n
The result will be a vector with a value of:\n- `1` if the instance is up', type='text')] what is the status of the prometheus instances?
